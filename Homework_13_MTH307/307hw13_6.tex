Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Suppose $S \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is invertible.  Prove that $T$ and $S^{-1}TS$ have the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicities.

\begin{proof}
    Since $T$ and $S^{-1}TS$ are similar matrices by change of bases. Then the characteristic polynomials of similar matrices are the same. Hence the eigenvalues are the same (and the multiplicities also).
\end{proof}
