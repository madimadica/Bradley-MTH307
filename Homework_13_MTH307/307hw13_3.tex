Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $\alpha , \beta \in \mathbf{F}$ with $\alpha \ne \beta$.  Prove that $G(\alpha, T) \cap G(\beta,T) = \{ 0 \}$.

\begin{proof} $ $
    By theorem 8.13 (Linearly independent generalized eigenvectors), since we have distinct $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by hypothesis, then $G(\alpha, T)$ and $G(\beta, T)$ are also form linearly independent subspaces. Then the only thing left in common is the zero vector. Hence $G(\alpha, T) \cap G(\beta,T) = \{ 0 \}$.  
\end{proof}
