Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$.  Prove that $V$ has a basis consisting of eigenvectors of $T$ if and only if every generalized eigenvector of $T$ is an eigenvector of $T$.

\begin{proof} ($\Longrightarrow$)
    Since we have a basis of eigenvectors ($\dim V$ of them) and generalized eigenvectors are a superset of an already spanning set, then the set of generalized eigenvectors is the same as the set of eigenvectors. Note that the number of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors cannot exceed $\dim V$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof} ($\Longleftarrow$)
    Since by our assumption all of the generalized eigenvectors are equivalent to the eigenvectors. Theorem 8.23 says that we have a basis of generalized eigenvectors (which are assumed to equal the eigenvectors), hence we have a basis of eigenvectors.
\end{proof}
