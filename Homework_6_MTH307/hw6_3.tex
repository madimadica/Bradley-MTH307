If $U$ and $W$ are invariant subspaces for $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ then $U+W$ is invariant for $T$.
\begin{mybox}
\begin{proof}
    Let $u \in U$ and $w \in W$. Then $T(u + w) = T(u) + T(w)$ by linearity. 

    \nl By our assumption of invariance, $T(u) \in U$ and $T(w) \in W$. Therefore\\$T(u) + T(w) \in U + W$ by the definition of Sum of Subspaces. This implies $T(u + w) \in U + W$ by linearity. Hence, $U + W$ is invariant under $T$.
\end{proof}
