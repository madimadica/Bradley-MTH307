\defn{$T^m$}\\
Suppose $T \in \L{V}$ and $m$ is a positive integer.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T^m$ is defined by 
    $$T^m = \underbrace{T \cdots T.}_{m \text{ times}}$$
    \item $T^0$ is defined to be the identity operator $I$ on $V$.
    \item If $T$ is invertible with inverse $T^{-1}$, then $T^{-m}$ is defined by 
    $$T^{-m} = (T^{-1})^m.$$
\end{itemize}

\defn{$p(T)$}\\
Suppose $T \in \L V$ and $p \in \mathcal P (\F)$ is a polynomial given by 
$$p(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + \cdots + a_m z^m$$
for $z \in \F$. Then $p(T)$ is the operator defined by 
$$p(T) = a_0I + a_1T + a_2T^2 + \cdots + a_mT^m.$$

\defn{product of polynomials}
\\ If $p, q \in \mathcal P (\F)$, then $pq \in \mathcal P (\F)$ is the polynomial defined by
$$(pq)(z) = p(z)q(z)$$
for $z \in \F$.
