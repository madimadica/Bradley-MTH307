Suppose $W$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(W)$ has no eigenvalues.  Prove that every subspace of $W$ invariant under $T$ is either $\{0\}$ or infinite-dimensional.
\begin{mybox}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $W$ is non-zero, finite dimentional, then by Theorem 5.21 it has an eigenvalue. Hence $T|_U$ has some eigenvalue $\lambda$ and consequently $T$ has that eigenvalue $\lambda$. This is a contradiction to the assumption that $T$ has no eigenvalues. Therefore $W$ must be $\{0\}$ or infinite dimentional to satisfy $T$'s assumption.
    \end{proof}
