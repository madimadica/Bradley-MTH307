Consider the statement: If $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and there exists an orthonormal basis $e_1, \ldots , e_n$ of $V$ such that $\|Te_j\| = \|T^*e_j\|$ for each $j$, then $T$ is normal.  Show that a counterexample to the statement is given by the matrix
    $T = \left(
  \begin{array}{cc}
    0 & 1  \\
    -1 & 2  \\
  \end{array}
\right)$ with respect to the standard basis in $\mathbf{R}^2$.

\nnl \textbf{Solution:}

\nl We have $\mathcal M(T^*) = \mat{0}{-1}{1}{2}$. Then,

\nl For $e_1$, 
$$\norm{Te_1} = \norm{ \mat{0}{1}{-1}{2} \vdouble10 } = \norm{ \vdouble{0}{-1} } = 1,$$
and
$$\norm{T^*e_1} = \norm{ \mat{0}{-1}{1}{2} \vdouble10 } = \norm{\vdouble01} = 1.$$
So $\norm{Te_1} = \norm{T^*e_1}$ holds. As for $e_2$,

$$\norm{Te_2} = \norm{ \mat{0}{1}{-1}{2} \vdouble01 } = \norm{ \vdouble12 } = 5,$$
and
$$\norm{T^*e_1} = \norm{ \mat{0}{-1}{1}{2} \vdouble01 } = \norm{\vdouble{-1}{2}} = 5.$$
So $\norm{Te_2} = \norm{T^*e_2}$ holds, and hence the hypothesis $\norm{Te_j} = \norm{T^*e_j}$ holds for each $j$. The conclusion then states that $T$ is normal, that is $TT^* = T^*T$. Checking this,
$$TT^* = \mat{0}{1}{-1}{2} \cdot \mat{0}{-1}{1}{2} = \mat{1}{-2}{-2}{5},$$
and 
$$T^*T = \mat{0}{-1}{1}{2} \cdot \mat{0}{1}{-1}{2} = \mat1225.$$
Since $TT^* \neq T^*T$, then $T$ is \textbf{not} normal. Hence, a counterexample.
